    "#1.Discuss string slicing and provide examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##Ans.String slicing is a fundamental concept in programming that allows you to extract a subset of characters from a string. It's a powerful technique used in various programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax for string slicing is:\n",
    "\n",
    "string[start:stop:step]\n",
    "\n",
    "- start: The starting index of the slice (inclusive).\n",
    "- stop: The ending index of the slice (exclusive).\n",
    "- step: The increment between indices (default is 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simple Slice:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_string = \"Hello World\"\n",
    "print(my_string[0:5])  # Output: \"Hello\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Extracts the first 5 characters from the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Slice with Step:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_string = \"abcdefg\"\n",
    "print(my_string[0:6:2])  # Output: \"ace\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Extracts every other character from the string, starting from the first character.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Negative Indices:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_string = \"Hello World\"\n",
    "print(my_string[-5:])  # Output: \"World\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Extracts the last 5 characters from the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Omitting Start/Stop:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_string = \"Hello World\"\n",
    "print(my_string[:5])  # Output: \"Hello\"\n",
    "print(my_string[6:])  # Output: \"World\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Omitting the start index starts the slice from the beginning, while omitting the stop index goes until the end of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reversing a String:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_string = \"Hello World\"\n",
    "print(my_string[::-1])  # Output: \"dlroW olleH\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Extracts the entire string in reverse order.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples demonstrate the versatility of string slicing in extracting specific parts of a string. The syntax may vary slightly depending on the programming language, but the concepts remain similar.\n",

    "#2.Explain the key features of lists in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Ans.In Python, lists are a fundamental data structure that offer a versatile way to store and manipulate collections of items. Here are the key features of lists in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ordered Collection: Lists are ordered, meaning that the order of the elements matters and is preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Mutable: Lists are mutable, which means you can modify their contents after creation (e.g., add, remove, or change elements).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Indexing: Lists support indexing, allowing you to access specific elements by their position (index) in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Slicing: Lists support slicing, enabling you to extract subsets of elements using a start:stop:step syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Dynamic Size: Lists can grow or shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Heterogeneous: Lists can store elements of different data types, including strings, integers, floats, and other lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Nested Lists: Lists can contain other lists, enabling the creation of complex data structures like matrices or trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Methods: Lists have various built-in methods for common operations like:\n",
    "    - append(): Add an element to the end.\n",
    "    - insert(): Insert an element at a specific position.\n",
    "    - remove(): Remove the first occurrence of an element.\n",
    "    - sort(): Sort the list in-place.\n",
    "    - reverse(): Reverse the list in-place.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. List Comprehensions: Python supports list comprehensions, a concise way to create lists from existing iterables or expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Iterability: Lists are iterable, allowing you to loop through their elements using for loops or other iteration constructs.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features make lists an essential tool in Python programming, suitable for a wide range of tasks, from simple data storage to complex data manipulation and processing.\n"

    "print(my_list)  # Output: [None, 2, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
